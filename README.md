# Task Pal
 ## Application Overview
 Our application, Task Pal, allows users to input their upcoming tasks and then generates a schedule for users to complete those tasks. When a user inputs a task, they provide an estimate of how long the task will take and the task's deadline. Task Pal is integrated with Google Calendar, so that it can plan around a user's existing events and generate events directly on a user's calendar.
